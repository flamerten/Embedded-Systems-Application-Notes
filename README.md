# Embedded Systems Application Notes <!-- omit in toc -->

A curated collection of application notes relevant to embedded systems engineers.

According to [Michigan State University](https://www.egr.msu.edu/classes/ece480/capstone/docs/app_note.html), an application note is a focused description of **how to** do something. It typically includes an introduction to the topic, precise implementation details, results, and recommendations.

While [curated collections of software engineering papers](https://interviewready.io/blog/white-papers-worth-reading-for-software-engineers) are common, resources for embedded systems engineers are scattered. This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing a structured, accessible library of application notes that are both practical and insightful.

Contributions are welcome! If you know a useful application note, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue with details.
